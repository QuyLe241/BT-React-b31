# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

    top: 218px;
    left: 113px;
    padding-left: 206px;
    background-color: rgba(255, 127, 0, 0.5);
    text-align: left;
    height: 136px;
